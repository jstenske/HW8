                As a finance and business analytics major, my coursework provides a strong foundation for me to showcase
                my accomplishments in scholarship and experiential learning. I have achieved Dean’s List status every
                semester before the COVID-19 pandemic began, and I completed the finance major with a 4.00 major GPA.
                Through my commitment to scholarship, I have been motivated to pursue experiential learning
                opportunities. One example is my participation as an equity research analyst for the Krause Fund in Fall
                2019. I excelled in conducting industry and company research in the Consumer Discretionary Sector and
                building financial models for this 585K student endowment fund. Additionally, I learned about Tippie’s
                China study abroad program through Tippie International Buddies, and I was able to participate in the
                program in May 2018. The study abroad program opened my global aperture by allowing me to meet with eBay
                and other companies to learn about China’s economy and the regulatory considerations for doing business
                in China. My experience studying abroad motivated me to encourage other Tippie students to study abroad.
                These experiences that Tippie afforded me led to my two internships as a Fund Operations Intern for
                Principal Global Investors (PGI), and a Middle Market Banking Analyst Intern at Wells Fargo. In summer
                2019, I developed a liquidity risk management monitoring and governance program to ensure compliance
                with the Mutual Fund SEC Liquidity Rule for senior management and the Mutual Fund Board at PGI. In
                summer 2020, I analyzed financial statements and forecasted base and worst-case scenario cash flows
                during COVID-19 at Wells Fargo.

                My experience as a summer intern at Wells Fargo and as an equity research analyst for the Krause Fund
                has emphasized my passion to help companies find value. In the future I hope to be in a position to
                perform credit evaluation for a large financial institution. I also plan on completing MBA or Master of
                Finance program as I gain more financial experience.

            <h2>Skills and Interests</h2>
            <p>


                I am proficient at Microsoft Access, Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. I have some experience in Python and R
                coding from my business analytics major. I also have a Bloomberg Market Concepts Certificate.

                Outside of work and school, you can find me playing golf, sand volleyball, watching Iowa sports or
                hanging out with friends. I also hope to tour
                Europe when the pandemic ends.
